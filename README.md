# firing-range
Pygame target practice script written in Pygame.
A very basic shooting game. Generates one target on a random x location on the screen.
Target will require any number of hits between 1-10. Head shots will drop target immediately. 
Press R to reset target and reload.

All artwork is my own. You may reuse the code and artwork for your own projects. Please give credit where it's due.

I am not at liberty to upload sound effects recorded from youtube videos.
