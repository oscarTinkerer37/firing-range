Pygame target practice script
A very basic shooting game. Generates one target on a random x location on the screen.
Target will require any number of hits between 1-10. Head shots will drop target immediately. 
Press R to reset target and reload.

All artwork is my own.

It appears I am not at liberty to upload sound effects recorded from youtube videos.
